**General Emphasis Throughout:**

- **Code Quality:** Apply software development best practices (clean code, comments, structure) to all Python/Go tools.
- **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for key functions in custom tools.
- **Security:** Incorporate security considerations (like DNSSEC, HTTPS) where applicable.
- **Design Patterns:** Consider appropriate design patterns for building more complex tools.
