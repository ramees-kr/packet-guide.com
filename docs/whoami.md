# 🧠 Who Am I — Explained Simply

Hi there! I'm a builder, a learner, and an explorer of the digital world — kind of like a modern-day inventor who works with computers instead of robots and wires.

You can think of me as someone who teaches machines how to talk to each other, work together, and solve problems — all without me having to be there pressing buttons every time. I make computers smarter, faster, and more reliable.

But I don’t just work with machines. I learn by doing, and I document everything I discover — just like a scientist keeping a lab journal.

## 🛠️ What Do I Actually Do?

I build projects around something called "DevOps" — it’s like making sure the whole digital factory runs smoothly. That includes:

- Making sure websites and apps stay online
- Teaching computers how to assign addresses (like giving houses on a street their own numbers)
- Watching and alerting when something goes wrong (like a smoke alarm)
- Automatically fixing issues or suggesting ways to fix them (sometimes using AI!)

I do all this by writing scripts, building tools, and creating dashboards that people and computers can both understand.

## ⏳ When Do I Do This?

I'm working on this every day — a little at a time — as part of a one-year mission to become really good at it. It's kind of like leveling up in a game, with each month bringing new quests, tools, and discoveries.

## 🌍 Where Do I Do This?

From my own digital lab — a project called **packet-guide.com**. It’s like my workshop and notebook all rolled into one.

Everything I build lives in:

- My GitHub (for code)
- My Notion (for planning)
- My blog (for storytelling)

## 🔥 Why Am I Doing This?

Because I love building, I love learning, and I believe that the best way to learn is by doing.

Also:

- Technology runs the world, and I want to understand how it all works
- I want to help others troubleshoot faster, automate smarter, and learn better
- I want to tell stories through my projects — not just code, but context

This isn’t just about getting a job — it’s about becoming the kind of person who can solve real problems using smart, creative systems.

## 🧭 My Mission

> Build, break, fix, learn — one packet at a time.

I’m not just writing code.
I’m writing my own operating manual for how to build and run modern infrastructure.

And the cool part? I’m inviting the world to follow along.
