# 📘 Project 08 – Static Dashboard (HTML)

A simple HTML+JavaScript dashboard designed to visually present infrastructure data specifically generated by earlier Packet Guide projects: Project 02 (DHCP Log Parser), Project 03 (System Docs Generator), and Project 05 (DNS Validator).

This project helps develop foundational frontend skills (HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS) by creating a visualization layer for the outputs of your previously built backend tools, laying the groundwork for understanding how different components in an infrastructure monitoring ecosystem can connect.

## 🧭 Overview

DevOps and SREs need ways to display system state. This project creates a single HTML page that acts as a simple, static reporting frontend for specific tools developed earlier in Packet Guide:

- Reads static JSON data files generated by Projects 02, 03, and 05
- Displays data related to DHCP leases, system information, and DNS validation status in formatted tables or basic summaries
- Can be updated by regenerating the input JSON files from the respective tools
- Uses only basic HTML/CSS/JS (no framework required)

This serves as a practical exercise in data presentation before moving to more dynamic systems like Grafana in Project 13.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) for DOM manipulation and fetching data
- Input Data Files (expected in `data/` directory):
  - `dhcp_summary.json` (from Project 02 output)
  - `system_info.json` (from Project 03 output)
  - `dns_validation.json` (from Project 05 output)
- Optional: Chart.js or Plotly.js for basic visualizations

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn how to present structured data visually using basic web technologies
- Practice loading and parsing JSON data with Vanilla JavaScript
- Integrate and visualize the outputs from specific prior Packet Guide projects (02, 03, 05)
- Build a modular static dashboard template
- Explore CSS layout and basic DOM scripting

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/packet-guide.com.git
   cd packet-guide.com/projects/08_static_dashboard
   ```
2. **Ensure Input Data Exists:** Generate the output JSON files from Project 02 (`dhcp_summary.json`), Project 03 (`system_info.json`), and Project 05 (`dns_validation.json`) and place them inside the `data/` directory.
3. Open `dashboard.html` locally in your browser:
   ```bash
   open dashboard.html  # macOS
   # or double-click the file in your file explorer
   ```
4. Or serve locally (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html
   ```

## 📄 Sample Data Formats

**`data/dhcp_summary.json` (Example from Project 02):**

```json
{
  "total_leases": 150,
  "recent_leases": [
    {
      "ip": "192.168.1.101",
      "mac": "aa:...",
      "hostname": "host-a",
      "timestamp": "..."
    },
    {
      "ip": "192.168.1.102",
      "mac": "bb:...",
      "hostname": "host-b",
      "timestamp": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**`data/system_info.json` (Example from Project 03):**

```json
{
  "hostname": "web-01",
  "os": "Ubuntu 22.04 LTS",
  "uptime": "3 days, 6 hours",
  "ip": "192.168.0.101",
  "memory_gb": 8,
  "cpu_cores": 4
}
```

**`data/dns_validation.json` (Example from Project 05):**

```json
[
  {
    "hostname": "dev.packet-guide.com",
    "expected_ip": "10.0.0.5",
    "actual_ip": "10.0.0.5",
    "status": "OK"
  },
  {
    "hostname": "stale.packet-guide.com",
    "expected_ip": "192.168.1.12",
    "actual_ip": "192.168.1.99",
    "status": "Mismatch"
  }
]
```

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to load specific JSON structures with JavaScript and populate the DOM
- Displaying data from multiple related sources on one page
- CSS layout techniques (flexbox, grid)
- Basic charting (Chart.js or native SVG) if used
- Building a simple reporting frontend for backend tools

---

## 🔁 Next Steps

- Add distinct sections or tabs for DHCP, System Info, and DNS data
- Embed basic visualizations (e.g., bar chart for lease count) if desired
- Refine CSS for better presentation
- Ensure the scripts generating the input JSON in Projects 02, 03, 05 produce the expected format
