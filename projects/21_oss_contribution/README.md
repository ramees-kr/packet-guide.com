# 📘 Project 21 – Open Source Contribution (Optional)

This capstone project focuses on giving back to the open-source community by contributing to one of the tools or libraries used throughout the Packet Guide journey. It’s an opportunity to apply learned skills in a real-world context, engage with a project’s community, and improve a tool that others rely on.

---

## 🧭 Overview

Packet Guide relies on numerous open-source tools and ecosystems (Python, Go, Terraform, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, etc.). Contributing back to these projects helps you:

- Deepen your understanding of how these tools are built and maintained
- Improve skills through code reviews and collaboration
- Sustain the projects that provide value
- Build a public portfolio of contributions

This project involves:

- Identifying a suitable open-source project relevant to Packet Guide themes
- Finding a manageable contribution opportunity (bug fix, documentation improvement, test addition)
- Following the project’s contribution workflow (forking, PRs, addressing feedback)
- Documenting the experience

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Target Project Languages/Tools:** Go, Python, HCL/Terraform, YAML/Kubernetes, JavaScript/HTML, etc.
- **Platforms:** GitHub or GitLab
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Communication:** Mailing lists, Slack/Discord, issue trackers

---

## 🎯 Goals

1. Practice a standard open-source contribution workflow (finding issues, forking, PRs, code review)
2. Enhance coding, testing, or documentation skills on an existing codebase
3. Engage constructively with maintainers and the community
4. Follow contribution guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) and code of conduct
5. Successfully merge a contribution (even a small one)
6. Reflect on the challenges and rewards of contributing to OSS

## 🚀 Contribution Process

1. **Identify Potential Projects:** Choose from tools used in Packet Guide (Terraform providers, Prometheus exporters, Go CLIs, Python scripts, Kubernetes tools, Grafana, etc.).
2. **Read Contribution Guidelines:** Review the project’s `CONTRIBUTING.md` and code of conduct.
3. **Find an Issue:** Look for issues labeled `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `documentation`, or `bug`.
4. **Communicate Intent:** Comment on the issue to prevent duplicate effort.
5. **Fork & Clone:** Fork the repo and clone it locally.
6. **Create a Branch:** `git checkout -b my-fix-or-feature`.
7. **Make Changes:** Implement fixes or updates, adhere to coding style, add tests if needed.
8. **Test:** Run the project’s test suite (e.g., `go test`, `pytest`).
9. **Commit & Push:** Write clear commit messages and push your branch.
10. **Open a Pull Request:** Describe the problem and your solution, linking to the issue.
11. **Engage in Review:** Respond to feedback, update your branch as needed.
12. **Merge:** Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR! 🎉
