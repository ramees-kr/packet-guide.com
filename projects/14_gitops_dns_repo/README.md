# üìò Project 14 ‚Äì GitOps DNS Repo

A Git-backed repository that defines and manages DNS zones and their DNSSEC configurations using Terraform, version control, and GitOps workflows.

This project focuses on treating DNS (including its security settings) as a version-controlled, declarative, reviewable system ‚Äî where every DNS change, including enabling/disabling DNSSEC or modifying related records, goes through Git and CI/CD.

---

## üß≠ Overview

Manual DNS updates via UI or CLI don‚Äôt scale and lack auditability. GitOps fixes this by:

- Defining all DNS zones, records, and DNSSEC settings (from Project 10) in Terraform
- Storing the entire desired DNS state in a Git repository
- Using CI/CD pipelines (or manual approval) to validate (`terraform plan`) and apply (`terraform apply`) changes
- Ensuring that changes to DNSSEC configurations follow the same rigorous review and automated checks as standard record changes
- Optionally using ArgoCD or Terraform Cloud for deployment orchestration

This project will mirror real-world patterns for:

- Infrastructure DNS and security
- Internal service discovery
- Multi-environment rollouts with consistent configurations

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Terraform v1.5+ (with provider supporting DNSSEC, e.g., Cloudflare)
- Git
- Cloud provider (Cloudflare, Route 53)
- GitHub / GitLab (or other Git platform with CI/CD)
- Optional:
  - Terraform Cloud or Atlantis for PR automation/state management
  - ArgoCD (for Kubernetes integration)
  - CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)

---

## üéØ Goals

- Build a Git-first repo to manage DNS state including DNSSEC
- Use pull requests for all DNS changes (records and security settings)
- Ensure DNSSEC configuration changes are visible in `terraform plan` output during PR review
- Track, review, and revert DNS changes (including DNSSEC state) with history
- Work with multiple environments (dev, prod) maintaining consistent security posture
- Prepare for future GitOps controller integration

## üìÑ Example DNS Record Change (in Git PR)

A pull request might modify `dns.tf` to change an IP or enable DNSSEC:

```diff
# environments/prod/dns.tf

resource "cloudflare_record" "api_prod" {
  zone_id = cloudflare_zone.packet_guide_prod.id
  name    = "api"
  type    = "A"
- value   = "192.168.10.5"
+ value   = "192.168.10.6"
  ttl     = 120
  proxied = false
}

# Enable DNSSEC if not already defined
+resource "cloudflare_zone_dnssec" "prod_dnssec" {
+  zone_id = cloudflare_zone.packet_guide_prod.id
+}
```

The CI `terraform plan` step in the PR will show the planned change to the A record and the creation/modification of the DNSSEC resource.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo (standalone or monorepo):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/packet-guide.com.git
   cd packet-guide.com/projects/14_gitops_dns_repo
   ```

2. Set up Terraform and secrets (ensure provider supports DNSSEC):

   ```bash
   export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="..."
   terraform init
   ```

3. Make changes on a feature branch (e.g., add a record or modify DNSSEC settings in `.tf` files).

4. Push branch and open a Pull Request.

5. Review CI output: verify `terraform plan` shows intended changes to records and DNSSEC status.

6. Approve and merge the PR.

7. CI/CD (or manual step) runs `terraform apply` on the main branch.

## üîÅ Next Steps

- Add CI/CD for `validate` and `apply` (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Use Terraform Cloud workspaces per environment for state management and run execution
- Add post-apply checks in CI to verify DNSSEC status (e.g., `dig +dnssec @<resolver> <domain> SOA`)
- Add documentation generator for DNS zone layout, including DNSSEC status
- Integrate with ArgoCD (if managing Kubernetes alongside DNS)
