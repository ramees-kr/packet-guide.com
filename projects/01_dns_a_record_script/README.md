# üìò Project 01 ‚Äì DNS A Record Script

A foundational DevOps and networking tool that automates the creation, deletion, and validation of DNS A records using Python.

This project simulates DNS-as-Code and teaches how DNS records work under the hood‚Äîusing scripting, providers, and error handling patterns found in real-world infra.

---

## üß≠ Overview

DNS is the backbone of modern networks. Manually managing A records (hostname ‚Üí IP address) is tedious and error-prone. This project automates that process by creating a CLI script that:

- Creates or deletes A records in a DNS zone
- Validates inputs (IP format, hostname format)
- Optionally interacts with public DNS APIs (Cloudflare, Route53) or local Bind9
- Logs the outcome of each operation

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- dnspython or requests
- Optional: Cloudflare API (requests) or AWS Route53 SDK (boto3)
- Logging module
- Click (optional) for CLI experience

---

## üéØ Goals

- Understand how A records are structured and resolved
- Learn to interact with a DNS service via CLI or API
- Handle DNS errors and propagation edge cases
- Log actions for audit/debugging
- Build a tool that simulates a DevOps DNS workflow

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/packet-guide.com.git
   cd packet-guide.com/projects/01_dns_a_record_script
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install dnspython requests
   ```
3. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python dns_tool.py add --hostname test.packet-guide.com --ip 192.168.1.20
   python dns_tool.py delete --hostname test.packet-guide.com
   ```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- ‚úÖ Add A record
- ‚úÖ Delete A record
- üîÑ Validate if A record matches a known IP
- üõë Detect and warn if record already exists or is missing
- üìú Log every action to `dns_tool.log`

---

## üß™ Example Output

**Console Output:**

```text
$ python dns_tool.py add --hostname dev.packet-guide.com --ip 10.0.0.5
INFO: Attempting to add A record: dev.packet-guide.com -> 10.0.0.5
INFO: Successfully added A record: dev.packet-guide.com -> 10.0.0.5

$ python dns_tool.py delete --hostname dev.packet-guide.com
INFO: Attempting to delete A record for: dev.packet-guide.com
INFO: Successfully deleted A record for: dev.packet-guide.com

$ python dns_tool.py add --hostname test.packet-guide.com --ip 192.168.1.20
WARN: A record already exists for test.packet-guide.com with IP 192.168.1.20. No action taken.
```

**Sample Log Line (`dns_tool.log`):**

```log
2025-04-22 21:30:00,123 - INFO - Successfully added A record: dev.packet-guide.com -> 10.0.0.5
2025-04-22 21:31:05,456 - INFO - Successfully deleted A record for: dev.packet-guide.com
2025-04-22 21:32:10,789 - WARNING - A record already exists for test.packet-guide.com with IP 192.168.1.20. No action taken.
```
