## Project Goal

The Cloud Resource Provisioner is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify and automate common AWS resource management tasks. It aims to reduce manual effort in the AWS console and provide a scriptable interface for infrastructure operations.

### Core Functionality:

- **EC2 Instance Management**: Launch, stop, terminate, and list EC2 instances based on predefined configurations or user input.
- **S3 Bucket Operations**: Create, delete, and list S3 buckets. Synchronize local directories with S3.
- **IAM Role/Policy (Basic)**: Attach predefined IAM policies to roles (future enhancement).
- **Configuration-driven**: Uses YAML configuration files to define resource specifications.

### Technical Details:

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `boto3`: AWS SDK for Python.
  - `click`: For creating beautiful command-line interfaces.
  - `PyYAML`: For parsing configuration files.
- **Development Practices**:
  - Unit tests with `pytest`.
  - Linting with `flake8` and formatting with `black`.

```javascript
// Example code block
// [!code highlight] // This whole line would be highlighted
function helloWorld() {
  // [!code word:helloWorld] // "helloWorld" would be highlighted (if char highlighting is set up for words)
  console.log("Hello from MDX!");
}
```

This tool was developed to address repetitive tasks in a development environment and serves as a practical example of using Python for cloud automation.
