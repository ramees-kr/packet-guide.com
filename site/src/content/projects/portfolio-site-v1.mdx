## Overview

This project is the development of `packet-guide.com`, a personal platform to showcase technical projects and share insights through blog posts. The core philosophy is minimalism, speed, and a delightful, distraction-free reading experience.

### Key Features Implemented:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** with Next.js for performance.
- **MDX-based content** for both blog posts and project descriptions, allowing for rich content with embedded components.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first styling, configured for a "CSS-first" approach.
- **Content-driven workflow**: Adding new blog posts or projects is as simple as dropping a new MDX file into the respective content directory.
- **Responsive design** for optimal viewing on all devices.
- **Dark Mode** support.

### Technology Stack:

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 19 (via Next.js)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- `next-mdx-remote` for MDX processing
- Hosted on Vercel

This project itself serves as a testament to the technologies and practices it employs. The source code is available for review (link above).
