## The Journey Begins

Welcome to the first post on this shiny new blog! I'm currently exploring the capabilities of **Next.js 14** (using the App Router) and how it pairs with **MDX** for content creation. The goal is a minimalist, fast, and developer-friendly platform.

### Initial Setup Thoughts

The setup process involved several key steps:

1.  Initializing the Next.js project.
2.  Configuring Tailwind CSS (using v4's CSS-first approach).
3.  Setting up MDX processing with `next-mdx-remote`.

So far, the developer experience has been quite smooth. The ability to write content in Markdown with the power of React components embedded is a game-changer.

```javascript
// Example code block
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello from MDX!");
}
```
