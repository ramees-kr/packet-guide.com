## A New Era for Tailwind

Tailwind CSS v4 has shifted its configuration paradigm significantly towards a **CSS-first** approach. This means less JavaScript configuration (`tailwind.config.js` or `.ts` is now often optional or minimal) and more power directly within your CSS files using directives like `@theme` and `@plugin`.

### Key Changes Observed:

- **CSS-First Configuration**: Defining theme variables, custom utilities, and even plugins happens primarily in your global CSS file.
- **Performance**: V4 boasts significant performance improvements.
- **Modern CSS Features**: It leverages modern CSS like cascade layers and `color-mix()`.

While it took a moment to adjust from the v3 way of doing things, the new system feels more integrated with the CSS pipeline. The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin, for instance, is now typically loaded with an `@plugin` directive in the CSS.

The journey with Tailwind v4 is just beginning, but the initial impressions are very positive. It feels like a robust and forward-thinking evolution of the framework.
