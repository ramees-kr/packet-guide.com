# 📦 Packet Guide

Welcome to Packet Guide — my personal DevOps + Networking lab.  
I'm learning by building — automating real-world DNS, DHCP, and observability workflows using Python, Go, and infrastructure tools like Terraform, Kafka, and Prometheus.

## 🔧 What You'll Find Here

- Hands-on infrastructure projects (DNS, DHCP, K8s, GitOps)
- Scripts, CLI tools, exporters, dashboards, and Kafka pipelines
- Project-based documentation and blog-style learning notes
- My journey from support engineer to platform/devops engineer

## 🗂 Structure

| Folder    | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| projects/ | Source code and docs for each project |
| docs/     | Logs, architecture, roadmap, diagrams |
| blog/     | Markdown articles and writeups        |
| lib/      | Reusable Go/Python scripts & modules  |
| site/     | (Optional) Static site for publishing |

## 🧭 My Learning Protocol

Every task follows the Packet Guidance protocol:

1. Plan in GitHub issues + Notion
2. Build in local project folder
3. Document via README + blog/log
4. Reflect weekly and improve
5. Reuse and modularize if possible
