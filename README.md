# 📦 Packet Guide

Welcome to Packet Guide — my personal DevOps + Networking lab.
I'm learning by building — automating real-world DNS, DHCP, and observability workflows, building and deploying simple applications, and using Python, Go, and infrastructure tools like Terraform, Kafka, Prometheus, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## 🔧 What You'll Find Here

- Hands-on infrastructure projects (DNS, DHCP, K8s, GitOps)
- Development of simple application services
- Scripts, CLI tools, exporters, dashboards, and Kafka pipelines
- Containerization and basic CI/CD practices
- Project-based documentation and blog-style learning notes
- My journey from support engineer to platform/devops engineer

## 🧭 My Learning Protocol

Every task follows the Packet Guidance protocol:

1.  Plan in GitHub issues
2.  Build in local project folder
3.  Document via README + blog/log
4.  Reflect weekly and improve
5.  Reuse and modularize if possible
